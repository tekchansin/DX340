## Audio & Kernel Profiles

### 🎧 OverSampling Modes
Select your preferred digital-to-analog processing style:
1. **Default iBasso:** The stock factory oversampling configuration.
2. **NOS Mode (Non-OverSampling):** Bypasses digital filtering for a raw, phase-coherent, and musical sound.
3. **Improved OverSampling Mode:** A custom-tuned oversampling algorithm designed for better transient response and reduced ringing artifacts.

### ⚙️ Kernel Boot Profiles
Control system processing and power delivery at the core:
1. **Extreme:** Maximize CPU performance and system responsiveness for the most precise audio processing.
2. **Analog:** Optimized power delivery and clocking to provide a smooth, organic, and "analog-like" sound signature with reduced digital glare.
3. **Default iBasso Boot:** Reverts the system behavior to the original factory specifications.
