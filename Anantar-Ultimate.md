## Key Features
* **MangoOS Compatibility:** Experience Anantar optimizations even in MangoOS. By configuring your profiles in Android first, the optimizations carry over to the dedicated OS.
* **New UI Design:** Featuring a refreshed interface and dedicated **Quick Settings Tiles** on the status bar for instant control.
* **Enhanced Sound Signature:** Improved clarity, better instrument separation, and a more natural, warm vocal delivery.
* **USB Mass Storage (UMS):** Full support for SD Card mass storage mode, enabling ultra-fast file transfers from MacOS and Android.
* **System Optimization:** Automatically cleans empty Android junk folders on your SD Card to maintain filesystem health.
* **Global USB DAC Support:** Enjoy high-fidelity USB DAC functionality across the entire Android system. You are no longer restricted to using the MangoPlayer; use your preferred apps like Tidal, Apple Music, or Spotify with full optimization.

## MangoOS Integration
Anantar Ultimate is designed to influence the system at a low level, allowing its benefits to persist across both OS environments.

**How to use with MangoOS:**
1. Boot into **Android Mode**.
2. Select your desired **Kernel Boot Profile**, **OverSampling Mode**, and **Harmonic Profile**.
3. Once configured, simply **Switch/Boot to MangoOS**.
4. Your chosen optimizations will remain active, providing the Anantar Ultimate sound signature within the MangoOS environment.

## Audio & Kernel Profiles

### 🎧 OverSampling Modes
Select your preferred digital-to-analog processing style:
1. **Default iBasso:** The stock factory oversampling configuration.
2. **NOS Mode (Non-OverSampling):** Bypasses digital filtering for a raw, phase-coherent, and musical sound.
3. **Improved OverSampling Mode:** A custom-tuned oversampling algorithm designed for better transient response and reduced ringing artifacts.

### ⚙️ Kernel Boot Profiles
Control system processing and power delivery at the core:
1. **Extreme:** Maximize CPU performance and system responsiveness for the most precise audio processing.
2. **Analog:** Optimized power delivery and clocking to provide a smooth, organic, and "analog-like" sound signature with reduced digital glare.
3. **Default iBasso Boot:** Reverts the system behavior to the original factory specifications.

## ⚠️ Known Issues
* **Module Deactivation after MangoOS Reboot:** When rebooting from **MangoOS back to Android**, the Magisk module may occasionally become disabled or "drop out."
    * **How to Check:** Pay attention to the **Boot Animation**. If you do not see the custom Anantar boot animation, the module has likely been disabled.
    * **Solution:** Simply go into the Magisk app and **Re-enable** the Anantar Ultimate module, then reboot once more.
